# Instructions
In this section we will see some droper codes, alternative code execution methods etc.

To compile our c# files we can use the csc compiler that is avaiable in windows os directly to make our code a standalone executable that will be portable or we can compile our code to a dll file.

`csc /target:exe /optimize program.cs`
`csc /target:library /optimize program.cs`
