If the payload is stored in the resource section we must first create a resources file, then we must create a resource header file and define a random number that the code will look for to find it. finally we must store our payload to an ico file and compile all aspects to an executable. example in the injection folder.

#### Every folder will contain a *compile.bat* file that you can directly run.
###### PS. Visual studio 2022 users will propably found problems in the ide. 
###### Example errors will be displayed because we obfuscate our functions. Compile it via developer command prompt in visual studio located at Tools > Command Line > Developer Command Prompt.
###### Finally run the bat file to directly make the compilation.
