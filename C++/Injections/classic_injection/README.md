#### Theory
*We create a malware that our metasploit payload will be stored in the resource section of the Portable Executable file.* 
* First we generate a x64 bit shellcode and store it in a bin file.
* Then we encrypt our shellcode with xor encryption and save it as an ico file.
* we create a resource file and a header file that will contain a random number which will be fetched from our code.
* After we use function call obfuscation technique to dynamicaly resolve our functions and bypass static analysis.
* Then we create two functions Findtarget that will try and find the process we will specify in the main of our program and Inject function will inject our shellcode to the remote process.
* Finally we use antisandbox techniques to check ram,hdd,cpu processes, this will help us detect sandboxes because many sandboxes does not have that amount of power.
